# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup: A Lab

Using Beautiful Soup, scrape [ChubbyGrub.com](http://chubbygrub.com), and create a DataFrame of food items from every restaurant. Your DataFrame should look something like this:

| restaurant | category | name    | calories | carbs | fat |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|-------|-----|
| McDonald's | Burgers  | Big Mac | 540      | 45    | 29  |
| Burger King | Burgers  | Whopper | 900      | 51    | 57  |
| ... | ...  | ... | ...      | ...    | ...  |
| Chili's | Ribs  | Shiner BockÂ® BBQ Ribs | 2310      | 168    | 123  |

## Deliverables
Create a Jupyter Notebook showing your code and submit a pull request.

**Note**: Your DataFrame should have 4977 rows
